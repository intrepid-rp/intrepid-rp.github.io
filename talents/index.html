  <h2>Magical Talents</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Combat Casting</h3>
  <em>Prerequisite: Ability to cast spells</em>
  <p>Experience on the battlefield has given you superior focus to cast your spells. You gain the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>You automatically succeed on CON saves to maintain your concentration on a spell if the DC is equal to or lower than a number equal to 8 + your PB (minimum DC 10).</li>
    <li>When a hostile creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a cantrip instead of making a melee attack.</li>
    <li>You can use a shield or weapon you are holding as a spellcasting focus—as normal, you can use the same hand or hands holding this focus to perform somatic spell components.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Elemental Savant</h3>
  <em>Prerequisite: Ability to Cast at Least One Damage-Dealing Spell</em>
  <p>Choose one of the following elemental damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can convert the damage type of that spell to your chosen elemental damage type. You must decide to convert the damage type when you declare you are casting the spell.</p>
  <p>Additionally, when you roll damage for a spell that naturally uses your chosen elemental damage type—not a spell you convert to your chosen type—you can reroll any damage dice results of 1. You must keep the new result.</p>
  <p>You can select this talent multiple times, selecting a different damage type each time.</p>

  <h3>Mental Fortitude</h3>
  <p>Through rigorous mental exercise, you have fortified yourself against mind-altering effects. You gain the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Once per long rest when you fail an INT, WIS, or CHA save, you can choose to reroll the save and take the new result.</li>
    <li>If an ongoing effect causes you to be charmed, frightened, or stunned due to failing a save, you can repeat the save at the end of each of your turns, ending the condition on a success—even if the effect would not typically allow you to do so.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mental Prowess</h3>
  <p>Your steadfast commitment to honing your mental capabilities has yielded results. Increase your CHA, INT, or WIS ability modifier by 1. You can't raise an ability modifier above +5 in this way.</p>
  <p>You can select this talent multiple times.</p>

  <h3>Ritualist</h3>
  <em>Prerequisite: Ability to Cast Spells</em>
  <p>Your study of magic has unlocked the mysteries of ritual spells. When you gain this talent, you also gain a ritual book, which contains the rituals you know. To cast a ritual spell, you must have your ritual book in hand.</p>
  <p>Choose a category of magic: arcane or divine. You must choose your rituals from that category's ritual list. Regardless of which category you choose, you use your normal spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
  <p>When you gain your ritual book, add one ritual of each spell tier you have already unlocked via your spellcasting class. For example, a cleric who selects this talent at 4th level has spell slots for the 1st and 2nd tiers, so they would add one 1st-tier ritual and one 2nd-tier ritual to their book.</p>
  <p>Each time you gain access to a new tier of spells by gaining a level in your spellcasting class, add one new ritual spell to your book. This new ritual must be from the same category of magic you originally chose, and it must be of a tier for which you have spell slots.</p>

  <h3>School Specialization</h3>
  <em>Prerequisite: Ability to Cast Spells</em>
  <p>Choose one of the eight schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. You gain the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Whenever you cast a spell from your chosen school that requires you to make an attack roll, you add +1 to that roll.</li>
    <li>Whenever you cast a spell from your chosen school that requires a target to make a save versus your spell save DC, the DC increases by 1.</li>
    <li>If you use a spellbook to cast your spells, the gold and time you must spend copying a spell of that school into your spellbook is halved.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can select this talent multiple times, selecting a different school of magic each time.</p>
