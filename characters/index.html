    <h2>Character Creation</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Choose a Lineage</h3>
    <p>Your character's lineage represents their inherited hereditary traits. For example, human, elf, and dwarf are common lineages in a fantasy setting.  A lineage includes the following aspects: Age, Size, Speed, and three physical traits.</p>
    <p>Unless specifically noted in the lineage description, your character's base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <p><ul>You have a few options:
      <li>Use an existing lineage from this guide. This is the quickest way to get started.</li>
      <li>Create a mixed lineage by combining traits from more than one lineage. The resulting lineage must have only three traits. Remember to be fair and balanced-- your game master may not allow cherry-picking the strongest options.</li>
      <li>Create your own lineage, compare it to existing lineages to ensure it's balanced, and see if your game master is happy with it.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Choose a Heritage</h3>
    <p>Heritage represents your character's culture and community. Each heritage option includes specific abilities, proficiencies, and languages.</p>
    <p><ul>You have a few options:
      <li>Use an existing heritage from this guide. This is the quickest way to get started.</li>
      <li>Create a mixed heritage by combining traits from more than one lineage. Remember to be fair and balanced. Your game master may not allow cherry-picking the strongest options.</li>
      <li>Create your own heritage, compare it to existing heritages to ensure it's balanced, and see if your game master is happy with it.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Choose a Background</h3>
    <p>Choose a background (or create your own) to represent your character's personal history.</p>
    <p><ul>Each background includes:
      <li>Two skill proficiencies</li>
      <li>Two additional language or tool proficiencies</li>
      <li>One talent</li>
      <li>Equipment</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Step 4: Choose a Class</h3>
    <p>Your character's class determines type of role or job they fulfill as adventurers.</p>
    <p><ul>Classes include the following elements:
      <li>The size of your hit die</li>
      <li>The number and type of spells you can cast (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Skill proficiencies</li>
      <li>Saving throw proficiencies</li>
      <li>Starting equipment</li>
      <li>Features and sub classes</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Step 5: Determine Ability Modifiers</h3>
    <p>Characters are defined by six abilities. Each ability is assigned a modifier that represents the character's mastery of that ability. Modifiers can increase as you level up to a maximum of 5.</p>
    <p>These modifiers are referred to using their three-letter abbreviation throughout this guide.</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Strength (STR)</td><td>Fight, lift, smash, grapple, swim, climb.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Dexterity (DEX)</td><td>React quickly, aim, balance, dodge, sneak, hide.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Constitution (CON)</td><td>Endure injury, resist poison, hold breath, avoid exhaustion.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Intelligence (INT)</td><td>Recall information, examine clues, make deductions, understand how things work.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Wisdom (WIS)</td><td>Perceive your surroundings, read body language, control animals.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Charisma (CHA)</td><td>Interact socially, lie, deceive, entertain, persuade, intimidate.</td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <div class="indent">
      <p><h4>Method A: Standard Array</h4>
        Use a standard array (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3 ) and assign each modifier to whichever ability you want.
      </p>
      <p><h4>Method B: Standard Pool</h4>
        <ul>Assign ability modifiers from a pool of 8 points:
          <li>The sum of all modifiers must equal 8, and each modifier must be between -2 and 4.</li>
          <li>For example: (1,1,1,1,2,2) and (-1,-1,0,2,4,4) are both valid.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>      
      <p><h4>Method C: Rolling Dice (optional)</h4>
        <ul>Optionally use this method if you enjoy rolling dice, don't mind the increased randomness, and your game master agrees:
          <li>Roll two d4s and subtract 4 for each ability modifier. This will generate ability scores between -2 and 4.</li>
          <li>Assign each modifier to whichever ability you want.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
