    <h2>Character Creation</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Step 1: Download a Character Sheet</h3>
    <p></p>
    <div id="nav-tiles" class="indent">
      <a href="/characters/character-sheet.pdf" class="nav-tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h3>Blank Character Sheet</h3>Grab this document and start your character sheet from scratch.</a>
      <a href="/characters/example-character.pdf" class="nav-tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h3>Example Character Sheet</h3>Use this as a reference for how to fill out your character sheet.</a>
    </div>

    <h3>Step 2: Choose a Lineage</h3>
    <p>Your character's lineage represents their inherited hereditary traits. For example, human, elf, and dwarf are common lineages in a fantasy setting.  A lineage includes the following aspects: Age, Size, Speed, and three physical traits.</p>
    <p>Unless specifically noted in the lineage description, your character's base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <p><ul>You have a few options:
      <li>Use an existing lineage from this guide. This is the quickest way to get started.</li>
      <li>Create a mixed lineage by combining traits from more than one lineage. The resulting lineage must have only three traits. Remember to be fair and balanced-- your game master may not allow cherry-picking the strongest options.</li>
      <li>Create your own lineage, compare it to existing lineages to ensure it's balanced, and see if your game master is happy with it.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Choose a Heritage</h3>
    <p>Heritage represents your character's culture and community. Each heritage option includes specific abilities, proficiencies, and languages.</p>
    <p><ul>You have a few options:
      <li>Use an existing heritage from this guide. This is the quickest way to get started.</li>
      <li>Create a mixed heritage by combining traits from more than one heritage. Remember to be fair and balanced. Your game master may not allow cherry-picking the strongest options.</li>
      <li>Create your own heritage, compare it to existing heritages to ensure it's balanced, and see if your game master is happy with it.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Choose a Background</h3>
    <p>Choose a background (or create your own) to represent your character's personal history.</p>
    <p><ul>Each background includes:
      <li>Two skill proficiencies</li>
      <li>Two additional language or tool proficiencies</li>
      <li>One talent</li>
      <li>Equipment</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Step 5: Choose a Class</h3>
    <p>Your character's class determines type of role or job they fulfill as adventurers.</p>
    <p><ul>Classes include the following elements:
      <li>The size of your hit die</li>
      <li>The number and type of spells you can cast (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Skill proficiencies</li>
      <li>Saving throw proficiencies</li>
      <li>Starting equipment</li>
      <li>Features and sub classes</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Step 6: Determine Ability Modifiers</h3>
    <p>Characters are defined by six abilities. Each ability is assigned a modifier that represents the character's mastery of that ability. Modifiers can increase as you level up to a maximum of 5.</p>
    <p>These modifiers are referred to using their three-letter abbreviation throughout this guide.</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Strength (STR)</td><td>Fight, lift, smash, grapple, swim, climb.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Dexterity (DEX)</td><td>React quickly, aim, balance, dodge, sneak, hide.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Constitution (CON)</td><td>Endure injury, resist poison, hold breath, avoid exhaustion.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Intelligence (INT)</td><td>Recall information, examine clues, make deductions, understand how things work.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Wisdom (WIS)</td><td>Perceive your surroundings, read body language, control animals.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Charisma (CHA)</td><td>Interact socially, lie, deceive, entertain, persuade, intimidate.</td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <div class="indent">
      <p><h4>Method A: Standard Array</h4>
        Use a standard array (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3 ) and assign each modifier to whichever ability you want.
      </p>
      <p><h4>Method B: Standard Pool</h4>
        <ul>Assign ability modifiers from a pool of 8 points:
          <li>The sum of all modifiers must equal 8, and each modifier must be between -2 and 4.</li>
          <li>For example: (1,1,1,1,2,2) and (-1,-1,0,2,4,4) are both valid.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>      
      <p><h4>Method C: Rolling Dice (optional)</h4>
        <ul>Optionally use this method if you enjoy rolling dice, don't mind the increased randomness, and your game master agrees:
          <li>Roll two d4s and subtract 4 for each ability modifier. This will generate ability scores between -2 and 4.</li>
          <li>Assign each modifier to whichever ability you want.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
    <p>Characters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20th level by gaining Story Points during their adventures. Story Points are granted by the game master when adventurers achieve significant story milestones such as a decisive victory, completing an important task, or making a key discovery.</p>
    <p>When your PC gains a new level, you gain access to the benefits listed in the progression table for your class at the new level. You also gain 1 hit die and more hit points as shown in your class description.</p>
    <p>The game master will either use the standard 5 points per level, or set their own number of story points required to achieve each level.</p>
    <table class="indent">
      <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Story Points</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>0 to 4</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>5 to 9</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>10 to 14</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>15 to 19</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>20 to 24</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6</td><td>25 to 294</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7</td><td>30 to 34</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8</td><td>35 to 39</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9</td><td>40 to 44</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10</td><td>45 to 49</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11</td><td>50 to 54</td></tr>
        <tr><td>12</td><td>55 to 59</td></tr>
        <tr><td>13</td><td>60 to 64</td></tr>
        <tr><td>14</td><td>65 to 69</td></tr>
        <tr><td>15</td><td>70 to 74</td></tr>
        <tr><td>16</td><td>75 to 79</td></tr>
        <tr><td>17</td><td>80 to 84</td></tr>
        <tr><td>18</td><td>85 to 89</td></tr>
        <tr><td>19</td><td>90 to 94</td></tr>
        <tr><td>20</td><td>95 and above</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The simplest form of leveling, called <strong>Milestone Leveling</strong>, is the equivalent of requiring one story point per level. The game master decides when the adventurers have reached a key milestone and let's them know they have levelled up. In this case, story points are not tracked between levels.</p>
