    <p>The Druid is a mystical wanderer deeply attuned to the natural world, embodying the primal forces of nature itself. With a spiritual connection to the earth, they draw power from the land, its creatures, and the elements. These enigmatic figures possess a unique blend of magical abilities, allowing them to shape-shift into animals and command the elements. Often found dwelling in secluded groves or traversing untamed wilderness, Druids serve as guardians of balance, advocating for harmony between civilization and nature. They wield potent nature magic to heal, protect, and manipulate the very fabric of the natural world to achieve their aims.</p>

      <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Animal Handling, Arcana, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Starting Equipment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a shield or (b) any simple weapon</li>
      <li>(a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
      <li>Leather armor and an explorer's pack</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spellcasting<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>As a conduit for primordial power, you can cast Primordial spells.</p>
    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Primordial spell list to learn. You choose more Primordial cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid Progression table.</p>
    <p><strong>Preparing Spells.</strong> You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Primordial spell list from tiers for which you have Primordial spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the Druid Progression table). You can choose a number of spells equal to your WIS modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.</p>
    <p>Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell tier for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.</p>
    <p><strong>Casting Spells.</strong> You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Primordial spell slot of the spell's tier or higher. The Druid Progression table shows how many Primordial spell slots you have per day at a given level. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spell save DC = 8 + PB + WIS</li>
      <li>Spell attack modifier = PB + WIS</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Rituals.</strong> You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don't need to be prepared, and they don't use up spell slots. At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Primordial ritual list. You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the Druid Progression table, but only from a tier for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level.</p>

    <h4>Druidic<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use a system of natural elements to leave hidden messages that only other druids will understand. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful WIS (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.</p>

    <h4>Nature's Gift<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You have learned to harness the ambient energy of nature and can redirect that energy to encourage growth and healing. As a bonus action, choose one creature within 5 feet of you (this can be you). When you do so, roll a number of d4s equal to your PB (minimum of 2d4). That creature regains hit points equal to the total rolled. This feature has no effect on Constructs or Undead.</p>
    <p>You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your PB. You recover expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>

    <h4>Wild Shape<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 2, 6, 13, and 18)</span></h4>
    <p>You gain the ability to channel energy directly from nature to produce effects beyond spells. You start with two effects: Beast Form and Draw Power. Some subclasses grant additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
    <p>When you use your Wild Shape feature, simply choose which specific effect you want, such as Beast Form. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your druid spell save DC.</p>
    <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape feature once until you finish a short or long rest, then twice between rests at 6th level, three times at 13th level, and four times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>Wild Shape: Beast Form</h5>
      <p>As an action, you can magically assume the form of a Beast. When you first gain this feature, choose two Beasts of challenge rating (CR) 1/4 or less as your known forms. To select a known form, you must have seen or interacted with a Beast in your past. For example, a druid that hails from a desert environment is unlikely to be familiar enough with a sea-dwelling creature like a dolphin to select it as a known form. The Beast you choose can't have any legendary actions or lair actions.</p>
      <p>You can choose additional beast forms as you gain levels. You know a total number of beast forms equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
      <p>When you gain a level of druid, you can replace one known form with a different form of your choosing. Any new form you choose must abide by the form restrictions.</p>
      
      <h5>Wild Shape: Draw Power</h5>
      <p>As a bonus action, you can reshape the natural energies around you to draw them within yourself and recharge your spellcasting ability. When you do so, choose a single expended Primordial spell slot to recover. The recovered spell slot must be of a tier equal to or less than your proficiency bonus (PB). For example, a 5th-level druid with a PB of +3 could recover an expended 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-tier Primordial spell slot with this feature.</p>
      <p>You can't use Draw Power while transformed by the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, even if you have multiple uses of Wild Shape available to expend.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Druid Subclass<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 3, 7, 11, and 15)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a subclass that reflects your values and magical practices. Your choice grants you spells and other features as you progress.</p>
    <p><strong>Druid Spells.</strong> Each subclass has a list of spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that tier (as shown on the Druid Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare. However, casting a druid spell still expends a Primordial spell slot as normal. If one of these spells isn't on the Primordial spell list, it still counts as a Primordial spell for you.</p>

    <h4>Talented<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a talent from the Martial Talents list or increase one ability modifier by +1.</p>

    <h4>Improved Beast Form<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 5, 9, and 14)</span></h4>
    <p>You can now use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature to assume more powerful beast forms. When you learn a new form, you can choose a Beast of CR 1/2 or less. At 9th level, you can assume the form of any Beast of CR 1 or less. At 14th level, you can assume the form of any Beast of CR 2 or less.</p>

    <h4>Heroic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 10)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the druid's path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rite of the Kingdom.</strong> All Beasts and creatures with the Animal tag understand your speech, and you can understand their noises and motions as if they were speaking, even if they don't speak a language. This ability doesn't grant Beasts the intelligence to understand or communicate complex concepts, but you can share basic information with ease. Your GM has final say on what a particular creature can express. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with or influence such creatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Rite of the Shaper.</strong> When you roll initiative and have no remaining uses of Wild Shape, you regain one use. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Nature's Grace<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 17)</span></h4>
    <p>Your attunement to the natural energies of the world infuses your body, sustaining you and protecting you from unnatural harm. You gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can't be magically aged, and you suffer none of the frailty of old age. You can still die of old age though.</li>
      <li>You no longer need food or water to survive.</li>
      <li>Your ability scores and hit point maximum can't be lowered by any means short of a wish spell.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Epic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 20)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the druid's path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archdruid.</strong> You can use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature an unlimited number of times. In addition, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of Primordial spells.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Druid Subclasses</h2>
  <hr/>

  <h3>Shifter</h3>
  <p>Druids that align with the ring of the Shifter feel a deep connection to the animals that walk the world. Shifters delve into the mysteries of transformation, spending much of their time in the forms of the beasts they so admire. To you, there is no greater joy than feeling wind beneath your wings, stalking prey on padded paws, or swimming through crystalline depths.</p>

  <h4>Potent Forms<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You can select more powerful creatures for the known forms used with the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature. When you gain this feature, you can choose any Beast or creature with the Animal tag with a CR of 1 or lower as a known form.</p>
  <p>In addition, you can now speak any language you know while in beast form—even if your chosen form would not typically allow you to do so. However, you still can't cast spells while transformed, even if a spell requires only a verbal component.</p>
  <p>At higher druid levels, you can choose beast forms with a CR as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down (ignoring CR limitations in your Improved Beast Form feature). For example, upon achieving 6th level of druid, you can choose any Beast of CR 2 or lower as a known form, CR 3 or lower at 9th level, and so on.</p>

  <h4>Quick Shift<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>By delving into the mysteries of the shifters, you have learned to change form more rapidly. When you use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, you can transform as a bonus action instead of as an action.</p>

  <h4>Shifter Spells<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain ring spells at the following druid levels. See the Druid Subclass class feature for how these spells work.</p>

  <h4>Beast's Fury<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn while in beast form, you can use your bonus action to make a single unarmed strike with your claws, hooves, fangs, or whatever natural weapon suits your chosen form. This attack deals 1d6 + your PB damage, and you are considered proficient with it. You decide if this attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you first assume your beast form.</p>
  <p>In addition, all damage you deal with melee weapon attacks while in beast form now counts as magical damage for the purposes of overcoming resistance or immunity to nonmagical damage.</p>

  <h4>Elemental Infusion<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>By expending two uses of the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, you can infuse your chosen form with one of the four elemental powers described here. Alternatively, you can use your reaction to spend one use of Wild Shape while already transformed by the Beast Form effect, either infusing yourself with one of the following powers or changing which power is active.</p>
  <p><strong>Air.</strong> You gain a 90-foot flying (hover) speed and are resistant to lightning and thunder damage. You gain the following action:</p>
  <ul><li><em>Whirl (Recharge 4-6).</em> Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you must make a STR save (DC 10 + your PB). On a failure, a target takes 3d8 + your PB bludgeoning damage and is flung up to 20 feet away from you in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target lands in the same space as another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or take the same damage and be knocked prone. The target is then prone in an adjacent unoccupied space. If the target's STR save is successful, a target takes half damage and isn't flung or knocked prone.</li></ul>
  <p><strong>Earth.</strong> You gain a 30-foot burrowing speed and can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing the material you move through. You gain tremorsense to a range of 60 feet and are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Melee attacks you make deal double damage to objects and structures.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire.</strong> You shed bright light in a 30-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You are immune to fire damage. Melee attacks you make deal an additional 1d8 fire damage. When you deal fire damage to a flammable creature or object, you can choose whether it ignites—an ignited target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse it. Your GM determines what constitutes a flammable creature or object.</p>
  <p><strong>Water.</strong> You gain a 90-foot swimming speed and can breathe underwater. You are resistant to cold and poison damage. You gain the following action:</p>
  <ul><li><em>Wave (Recharge 4-6).</em> Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a STR save (DC 10 + your PB). On a failure, a target takes 2d8 + your PB bludgeoning damage. If a target is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe in water. On a successful STR save, a creature takes half damage and isn't grappled. At the start of each of your turns, each target grappled by you takes 2d8 + your PB bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of a grappled target can pull it out of the grapple if it expends an action to attempt a DC 14 STR (Athletics) check—freeing the target on a success.</li></ul>
  
  <h4>Manifold Mind<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>You can now cast Primordial spells while in beast form, and your form doesn't hinder performing the somatic and verbal components of spells. You must still provide any required material components as normal.</p>
