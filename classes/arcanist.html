    <p>The Arcanist is a quintessential master of magic, wielding arcane power with scholarly rigor and intellectual prowess. They are seekers of ancient lore and guardians of esoteric knowledge. Armed with a spellbook containing a vast array of spells painstakingly transcribed and meticulously studied, they can shape reality itself with their incantations, conjuring flames to scorch their foes, weaving intricate illusions to confound their enemies, or unraveling the threads of time to manipulate fate itself. The arcanist navigates the perils of the world with a mind as sharp as their spells are potent, standing as a beacon of intellect and power.</p>

    </ul>

    <h4>Starting Equipment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger</li>
      <li>An arcane focus</li>
      <li>A spellbook</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spellcasting<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <h5>Spellbook</h5>
    <p>As a student of Arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing the spells you have learned. At 1st level, your spellbook contains six 1st-tier Arcane spells of your choice. It is the repository of all the Arcane spells you knowâ€”except for your cantrips, which are so simple and well-rehearsed that you don't even need to write them down.</p>
    <h5>Cantrips</h5>
    <p>At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist Progression table.</p>
    <h5>Preparing Spells</h5>
    <p>You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell in your spellbook for which you have Arcane spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the Arcanist Progression table.) You can choose a number of spells equal to your INT modifier + your arcanist level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.</p>
    <p>Preparing a new list of spells requires time studying your spellbook and re-memorizing incantations and gestures: at least 1 minute per spell tier for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.</p>
    <h5>Casting Spells</h5>
    <p>You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell's tier or higher.</p>
    <p>The Arcanist Progression table shows how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-tier and two 2nd-tier spell slots, and with a +3 INT, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd tier, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-tier spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-tier spells, you won't be able to use your 1st-tier spell slots at all.</p>
    <p>Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h4>Arcane Recovery<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day, when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended Arcane spell slots of your choice. Recovered spell slots can have a combined tier total equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up).</p>
    <p>For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two tiers' worth of spell slots. So you could choose to recover either a single 2nd-tier spell slot or two 1st tier spell slots.</p>

    <h4>Magic Sense<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 2)</span></h4>
    <p>You learn to perceive magical workings. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect magical forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures with spellcasting ability, ongoing spell effects, or magic items within 30 feet of you. If the magical effect is the result of an ongoing spell, you learn which school of magic the spell belongs to.</p>
    <p>This sense can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB + 1. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses.</p>

    <h4>Arcanist Subclass<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 3, 7, 11, and 15)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a subclass that reflects your specialized field of magical study, detailed at the end of this class. Your choice grants you features as you gain levels.</p>

    <h4>Talented<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a talent from the Magic Talents list or increase one ability modifier by +1.</p>

    <h4>Rote Spell<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 5, 9, 13, and 17)</span></h4>
    <p>Your continued practice of spellcraft has honed your mind, allowing you to affix a limited number of spells in your mind. Choose one 1st-tier Arcane spell from your spellbook, and that spell is now a rote spell. You always have a rote spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare during a long rest. Casting a rote spell still uses a spell slot as normal.</p>
    <p>Over the course of 8 hours or as part of a long rest, you can exchange one rote spell for a different Arcane spell of the same tier contained in your spellbook.</p>
    <p>At higher levels, you can select more rote spells: you choose a 2nd-tier Arcane spell to become a rote spell at 9th level, a 3rd-tier Arcane spell at 13th, and a 4th-tier Arcane spell at 17th.</p>

    <h4>Superior Recovery<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 6)</span></h4>
    <p>When you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can choose to swap out a number of prepared Arcane spells with different Arcane spells from your spellbookâ€”in addition to recovering Arcane spell slots. You can swap out a number of prepared spells equal to half your PB (rounded down) in this way.</p>

    <h4>Heroic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 10)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the arcanist's path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><h5>Rite of the Ritualist</h5>. When you learn a new ritual as part of gaining a level of arcanist, you can choose it from any source of magic. In addition, you can now copy ritual spells from any source of magic into your spellbook. Any rituals gained in this way count as Arcane spells for you.</li>
      <li><strong>Rite of the Source Master</strong>. Choose the Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd source of magic. When you add new spells to your spellbook as part of gaining a level of arcanist (including the level you gain this feature), you can choose spells from the Arcane spell list or spells from your chosen source. Each spell must be a of a tier for which you have spell slots. In addition, you can now copy spells of your chosen source into your spellbook. Any spells gained in this way count as Arcane spells for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spellguard<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 14)</span></h4>
    <p>Your knowledge of magic allows you to better assess the intentions and power of hostile spells and spell attacks, increasing your chance to avoid their effects. You have advantage on saves against spells and resistance to damage dealt by spells and spell attacks.</p>

    <h4>Spell Mastery<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 18)</span></h4>
    <p>You can cast each of your rote spells at their lowest tier once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a rote spell, you can't cast that same spell in this way again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p>If you want to cast any of your rote spells at a higher tier, you must expend an Arcane spell slot as normal.</p>

    <h4>Epic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 20)</span></h4>
    <p>When you cast a spell that spell expends an Arcane spell slot, you can choose to roll a d10. If the number rolled is higher than the tier of the expended spell slot, you automatically recover that slot. For example, if you expend a 1st tier spell slot, a result of 2 or higher on the d10 means that you recover that 1st-tier spell slot. Once you successfully recover a spell slot in this way, you can't use this feature again until you complete a short rest.</p>

  <h2>Arcanist Subclasses</h2>
  <hr/>
  
  <h3>Battle Mage</h3>
  <p>Wizards who follow the Battle Mage tradition aren't interested in theoretical musings or tedious experiments. Instead, they pursue new ways to enhance their power so that they can destroy their foes (and defend their allies) with ever-greater efficiency.</p>

  <h4>Expanded Talent List<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>When your gain a new talent, you can select it from either the magic or the martial talents list.</p>
  
  <h4>Spell Ward<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You can redirect a portion of your spellcasting energy into a defensive shield. When you cast an Arcane spell of 1st tier or higher, you can simultaneously weave a protective ward around yourself.</p>
  <p>While the ward is active, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>You gain a bonus to your armor class (AC) equal to your PB.</li>
    <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The ward lasts for 1 minute, but ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't cast an Arcane spell of 1st tier or higher since your last turn. You can also choose to dismiss your ward at any time (no action required by you).</p>
  <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
  
  <h4>Tactical Caster<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>When you cast an Arcane spell that causes damage, you can choose yourself and any number of allies you can see to be immune to the damage caused by the spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
  
  <h4>Contingency Plan<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>When you fail to hit a creature with a spell attack, you can use your reaction to redirect the spell toward a different target within the spell's range. You must make a new spell attack roll for the new target. If you miss the new target, you can't redirect again with the same spell attack.</p>
  
  <h4>Blasting Power<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>When you deal damage with an Arcane spell, you can reroll any 1s you roll on any number of the damage dice. You must take the new result for any dice rerolled in this way (even if the new result is also a 1).</p>
  
  <h4>Counterstrike<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>When a creature succeeds on a save against an Arcane spell you cast and would take no damage or otherwise suffer any effects, they instead take force damage equal to a number of d6 dice equal to the spell's tier + your INT modifier.</p>
  
  <hr/>

  <h3>Necromancer</h3>

  <h4>School Specialization<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>The gold and time you must spend to copy an Necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved. You may add Necromancy spells or rituals to your spellbook from other categories of magic, as if they were Arcane spells.</p>
  <p>When you cast necromancy spells, your spell attack bonus and spell save DC are both increased by 1.</p>

  <h4>Necrotic Regulation<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You have resistance to necrotic damage, and your HP maximum can't be reduced.</p>
  <p>Once per turn when you use a spell to reduce a living creature (excluding constructs and undead) to zero HP, you regain HP equal to twice the spell's tier, or three times its tier for necromancy spells.</p>
  
  <h4>Undead Thralls<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>You add the Animate Dead ritual to your spellbook if it is not there already. You can use your action to cast Animate Dead using a spell slot. You can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate. Undead that you create have additional benefits:</p>
  <ul clas="indent">
    <li>The creature's HP maximum is increased by an amount equal to your arcanist level.</li>
    <li>The creature adds your PB to its weapon damage rolls.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Shadow Summons<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>You can all undead under your control to the plane of shadows as an action, and summon them again as an action. They appear in a location you can see within 60 ft of you. HP that you regain by spending hit die also applies to undead under your control. Your undead may still break free of your control while on the shadow plane. While your undead are on the shadow plane, they may still break free of your control and you can reassert your control before summoning them.</p>
  
  <h4>Command Undead<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your arcanist spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</p>
  <p>Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3>Spelldancer</h3>
  <h4>Natural Athlete<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, or Performance. When you gain a new talent, you can select it from either the magic or the martial talents list.</p>

  <h4>Spell Dance<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>The somatic components of spells you cast are interwoven into your dance and unrecognizable to anyone besides other spelldancers. As a bonus action on your turn, you can begin a spell dance that lasts up to 10 minutes and grants you the following benefits. You can perform your spell dance PB times per long rest.</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Your AC = 10 + DEX + INT</li>
    <li>Your speed increases by 10 feet</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Ascendant Dancer<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>You learn two new skills that apply while you perform your spell dance:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>You can dodge out of the way of area effects that force you to make a DEX save. You take no damage if you succeed on the save, and only half damage if you fail.</li>
    <li>You learn to call on the elements. When you attack, you add one additional damage die to the attack's damage. You choose which type of damage from cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Graceful<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>Choose one skill from Acrobatics, Athletics, or Performance. If you are proficient in that skill, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10 whenever you make an ability check for that skill. During your spell dance, you gain a jump distance equal to your walking speed.</p>

  <h4>Virtuoso<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>Each time you start a spell dance, you can activate an aura which affects any number of creatures you choose within 30 feet:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li><strong>Protective Aura.</strong> Add +1 to AC and saving throws.</li>
    <li><strong>Healing Aura.</strong> Regain +1d4 HP when your dance begins and at the start of their turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggresive Aura.</strong> Add an additional die to attack damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Blindsight Aura.</strong> Perceive your surroundings without relying on sight.</li>
  </ul>
