    <p>Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw their magical abilities from their devotion to a specific deity, philosophy, or cosmic force, channeling divine energy to perform miracles, banish undead, and bolster their allies in battle. With their strong connection to the divine, clerics are not only capable healers and buffers but also formidable combatants, wielding both martial and magical prowess in service of their chosen cause. Clerics are versatile adventurers, able to fulfill various roles within a party, from frontline combatant to support caster.</p>

      <li>A shield and a holy symbol</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spellcasting<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <h5>Spellbook</h5>
    <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Divine spells.</p>
    <h5>Cantrips</h5>
    <p>Choose three cantrips from the Divine spell list to learn. You choose more at higher levels, as shown in Cleric Progression table.</p>
    <h5>Preparing Spells</h5>
    <p>You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Divine spell list from tiers for which you have Divine spell slots. You can choose a number of spells equal to your WIS + cleric level. This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.</p>
    <p>Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell tier for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.</p>
    <h5>Casting Spells</h5>
    <p>You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Divine spell slot of the spell's tier or higher. The Cleric Progression table shows how many spell slots you have at a given level. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
    <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
    <p>Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC and the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>Spell save DC = 8 + PB + WIS</li>
      <li>Spell attack modifier = PB + WIS</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Rituals</h5>
    <p>You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don't need to be prepared, and they don't use up spell slots.</p>
    <p>Choose one ritual from the Divine ritual list. You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Cleric Progression table, but only from a tier for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level.</p>
    <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
    <p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Divine spells.</p>

    <h4>Manifestation of Faith<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>Clerics demonstrate their faith in one of two primary ways, wielding it as a holy warrior or calling it as a miracle worker. Choose how you manifest your faith with one of the following:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Manifest Might.</strong> You gain proficiency with heavy armor and one type of martial weapon of your choice. In addition, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy: once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal additional radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to your PB.</li>
      <li><strong>Manifest Miracles.</strong> You learn one additional cantrip of your choice from any source of magic. This cantrip counts as a Divine cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, you can add your PB to the damage you deal with any Divine cantrip.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Channel Divinity<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 2, 6, 13, and 18)</span></h4>
    <p>You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity to produce effects beyond spells. You start with one effect: Turn the Profane. Some subclasses grant additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in their descriptions. When you use your Channel Divinity feature, choose which specific effect you want, such as Turn the Profane. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your cleric spell save DC.</p>
    <p>You can use your Channel Divinity feature once until you finish a short or long rest, then twice between rests at 6th level, three times at 13th level, and four times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>

    <div class="indent">
      <h5>Channel Divinity: Turn the Profane</h5>
      <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer to censure unholy creatures. Each Fiend and Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must make a WIS save. If the creature fails its save, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
      <p>A turned creature must try to move as far away from you as it can, though it can't first get closer to you to do it. On its turn, it can use only the Dash action or otherwise try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, it can use the Dodge action. It can't take any reactions.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Cleric Subclass<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 3, 7, 11, and 15)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a subclass that reflects your relationship to your deity. Your choice grants you spells and other features.</p>
    <p><strong>Domain Spells.</strong> Each cleric subclass has a list of domain spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that tier. Once you gain such a spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare. However, casting a domain spell still expends a Divine spell slot as normal.</p>
    <p>If one of these spells isn't on the Divine spell list, it still counts as a Divine spell for you.</p>

    <h4>Talented<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a talent from the Martial Talents list or increase one ability modifier by +1.</p>

    <h4>Destroy the Profane<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17)</span></h4>
    <p>When a Fiend or Undead fails its save against your Turn the Profane feature, it is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating (CR) is at or below a certain threshold:</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Challenge Rating</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>CR 1/2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8</td><td>CR 1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11</td><td>CR 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>14</td><td>CR 3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>17</td><td>CR 4</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Divine Intervention<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 9)</span></h4>
    <p>You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. At the start of your turn, you can request aid from your deity by rolling a d20 and adding your PB. If the result is 19 or lower, your request fails, and your deity doesn't intervene. If the result is 20 or higher, your deity intervenes on your behalf, imbuing you with a fraction of their power.</p>
    <p>If your deity intervenes, you can immediately use your action to cast any spell with a casting time of 1 action from the Divine spell list or your domain spell list, regardless of preparation rules. Casting a spell in this way doesn't expend a spell slot and doesn't require material components. If the spell is of a higher tier than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC for this check equals 10 + the spell's tier. On a failed check, the spell fails, your deity's power fades, and your action is lost.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, on a successful intervention, your GM can propose the form of the intervention. Anything that replicates the effects of a Divine spell is appropriate. In this instance, you still use your action but don't cast a spell. You have final say on allowing the GM to pursue this option or choosing your own spell.</p>
    <p>If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 1 week. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h4>Heroic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 10)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the cleric's path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Gift of Consecration.</strong> You are now immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. If you die, your body is instantly preserved as per the gentle repose spell for up to a year and a day.</li>
      <li><strong>Gift of Wrath.</strong> Choose either the radiant or necrotic damage type. You are now resistant to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage of any type, you can choose for it to deal radiant or necrotic damage instead (you choose which each casting).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Epic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 20)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the cleric's path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Divine Herald.</strong> When you use your Divine Intervention feature, your deity automatically intervenes without a roll, and you no longer have to wait a week before you use Divine Intervention again, though you can still use it only once per long rest. You are still bound by the other restrictions of the feature.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Cleric Subclasses</h2>
  <hr/>

  <h4>Channel Divinity<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain the following Channel Divinity option:</p>
  <h5>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h5>

Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. This healing has no effect on Undead or Constructs.</p>

  <h4>Disciple of Life<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>Your healing spells are more effective. When you use a Divine spell of 1st tier or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's tier.</p>

  <h4>Blessed Healer<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>Healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a Divine spell of 1st tier or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's tier.</p>

  <h4>Greater Preservation<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>The Preserve Life effect of your Channel Divinity feature can now affect any creatures within 60 feet of you. In addition, when you use Preserve Life, one target of your choice can also receive one of the following benefits:</p>

    <li>End one of the following conditions affecting the target: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</li>
    <li>Neutralize all poisons affecting the target.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Perfect Healing<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>When you cast a Divine spell of 1st tier or higher that restores hit points, you automatically restore the maximum possible number of hit points. For example, if a cure wounds spell heals 1d8 + 3 hit points, rather than rolling, the target heals 11 hit points.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3>War Domain</h3>
  <p>Gods of the War domain celebrate strength, the glory of victory, and the thrill of competition. Those gods with evil or chaotic proclivities emphasize destruction and violence, but most societies and heroic characters worship war gods who honor courage and excellence in battle and cherish those who fight when the need is great.</p>

  <h4>Channel Divinity<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain the following Channel Divinity option:</p>
  <h5>Channel Divinity: Mark of Triumph</h5>
  <p>As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and mystically mark one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. Until the start of your next turn, all creatures who attack a marked creature have advantage on the first attack roll they make against it.</p>

  <h4>Disciple of War<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>Victory brings you closer to the divine, inspiring you to press beyond your normal limits. Once per turn, when you successfully hit a creature with an attack while using the Attack action, you can choose to make an additional weapon attack as part of that same action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

  <h4>Expanded Talent List<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>When you gain a new talent, you can select that talent from the magic or martial talent list.</p>

  <h4>Blessed Warrior<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>Attacks you make are particularly potent. When you deal damage with a weapon or spell attack made with a Divine spell, you can reroll any 1s you roll on the damage dice. You must take the new result for any dice rerolled in this way.</p>

  <h4>Greater Triumph<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>When you use the Mark of Triumph effect of your Channel Divinity feature, you can mystically mark a number of creatures equal to your PB. All targets must be within 60 feet of you. In addition, when a creature marked by your Mark of Triumph feature is reduced to 0 HP, you can use your reaction to move the mark to a different target within 60 feet of you that you can see. A mark moved in this way still disappears at the start of your next turn, as normal.</p>

  <h4>Holy Strike<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>Once per turn, when you successfully hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack made with a Divine spell, you can treat the attack as if you rolled a critical hit.</p>
