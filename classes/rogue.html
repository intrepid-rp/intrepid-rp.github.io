    <p>Rogues are masters of stealth, agility, and adaptability, making them invaluable in diverse challenges. Their diverse skills enable them to tackle a wide range of obstacles, from picking locks and disarming traps to sneaking past guards. Every rogue is unique, thriving in high-pressure scenarios and embracing the call to adventure. In combat, they rely on speed and precision, striking from the shadows and targeting weak points. Though not built for front-line defense, their ability to dart around the battlefield and deliver lethal blows to unguarded enemies makes them formidable opponents. Rogues excel at overcoming obstacles swiftly and quietly, embodying the essence of resourceful adventurers.</p>

      <li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 8 + CON at first level.<br/>
        <span class="indent">Add 1d8 + CON at new levels.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Proficiencies</h4>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons with the Finesse property</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves' tools</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> DEX, INT</li>
      <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Starting Equipment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword</li>
      <li>(a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword</li>
      <li>(a) a burglar's pack, (b) a dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>Leather armor, two daggers, and a set of thieves' tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Expertise<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 1 and 6)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency. Double your PB for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, choose two more of your proficiencies (any combination of skills or tools) to gain this benefit.</p>

    <h4>Sneak Attack<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The weapon you use must have the Finesse property or be a ranged weapon.</p>
    <p>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
    <p>The amount of your extra damage you deal increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Progression table.</p>

    <h4>Thieves' Cant<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>During your rogue training, you learned Thieves' Cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature who knows Thieves' Cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey a message in Thieves' Cant than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>
    <p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>

    <h4>Cunning Action<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 2)</span></h4>
    <p>Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>

    <h4>Rogue Subclass<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 3, 7, 11, and 15)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a subclass that represents your specialized set of skills. Your choice grants you features as you gain levels.</p>

    <h4>Talented<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a talent from the Magic Talents list or increase one ability modifier by +1.</p>

    <h4>Uncanny Dodge<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 5)</span></h4>
    <p>When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack's damage against you by half.</p>

    <h4>Evasion<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 6)</span></h4>
    <p>You can dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a DEX save to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail.</p>

    <h4>Reliable Talent<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 9)</span></h4>
    <p>You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. When you make an ability check with a skill, tool, or vehicle that you have proficiency with, treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as if you rolled a 10.</p>

    <h4>Heroic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 10)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the rogue's path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Escape Artist.</strong> When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make any kind of save (including DEX saves) to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail.</li>
      <li><strong>Jack of All Trades.</strong> When you gain a new talent, you can choose it from any talent list. Immediately gain one talent of your choice (that you meet the prerequisites for) when you gain this feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Precise Critical<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 13 and 17)</span></h4>
    <p>You score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20 with ranged weapons and weapons with the Finesse property. In addition, you can roll one additional weapon damage die (not an additional Sneak Attack die) when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ranged weapon attack or attack made with a Finesse weapon.</p>
    <p>This extra damage increases to two additional dice at 17th level.</p>

    <h4>Keensense<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 14)</span></h4>
    <p>You have keensense to a range of 10 feet. Your keensense ceases to function while you are deafened or otherwise deprived of hearing.</p>

    <h4>Elusive<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 18)</span></h4>
    <p>You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. While you aren't incapacitated, attack rolls can't have advantage against you, regardless of the source of advantage.</p>

    <h4>Epic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 20)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the rogue's path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Stroke of Luck.</strong> You have got it when it counts. If your attack misses a target within normal range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Rogue Subclasses</h2>
  <hr/>

  <h3>Thief</h3>
<p>You have a reputation for quick thinking and quicker fingers. Leave throat-cutting and con-running to lesser scoundrels. You live to liberate treasures held under lock and key. The thrill of bypassing a sealed door, complex trap, or other “impassable” obstacle is the true prize—followed by the payday that comes from whatever you took.</p>

<h4>Fast Hands<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
<p>Experience has honed your skills, allowing you to accomplish precision work in a flash. In addition to its standard uses, you can now use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action feature to do any of the following:</p>
<ul class="indent">
  <li>Make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check.</li>
  <li>Take the Use an Object action.</li>
  <li>Use thieves' tools to attempt to disarm a trap or open a lock.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Second-Story Work<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
<p>You've never met a wall you couldn't conquer, and climbing them is second nature. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed when you gain this feature, it increases by 10 feet.</p>
<p>In addition, when you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet equal to your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap half your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In the event a STR (Athletics) check is required to clear or extend a jump, you can choose to make a DEX (Acrobatics) check instead.</p>

<h4>Appraising Eye<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
<p>You've developed an eye for quality. As an action, you can inspect any object within 10 feet of you that you can see to learn whether it is nonmagical or magical. If the object is nonmagical, you immediately learn its approximate value in gold pieces. You also learn whether the object is fake or could conceal other objects inside it (though you don't learn whether it is currently concealing objects or what those objects are).</p>
<p>If the object is magical, you can spend 1 minute examining it to learn its type, rarity, whether it is cursed, and if it requires attunement (and any specific attunement requirements it has). After you have examined a magic item in this way, you learn how to use it and can ignore any class or feature requirements that would normally prevent you from using it (though you still must abide by any level restrictions). If a magic item requires the use of a spellcasting ability, use your DEX to determine your spell save DC or spell attack bonus.</p>

<h4>Trap Specialist<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
<p>When you or a creature within 5 feet of you triggers a trap, you can use your reaction to roll an ability check to attempt to disarm the trap. If you are successful, the trap is disarmed and not triggered. If you are unsuccessful, the trap is triggered as normal.</p>
<p>In addition, you can now disarm any magical traps that would typically require the use of the dispel magic spell. When you do so, make an ability check using only your DEX modifier, without adding any other modifiers to the roll. If the result meets or exceeds the trap's DC (your GM has this number), it is disarmed as if you had successfully cast the dispel magic spell.</p>

<h4>Thief's Reflexes<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
<p>You have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. Now, you can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature if you are surprised.</p>
