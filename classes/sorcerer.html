    <img src="/assets/images/classes/sorcerer.jpg" />
    <p>Sorcerers are wielders of innate magic, drawing power from their bloodline or mysterious origins. Unlike arcanists who learn to cast spells through rigorous study, sorcerers harness raw arcane energy, casting spells with a natural talent. Sorcerers thrive on creativity and instinct, shaping magic with sheer will. This innate connection grants them unparalleled versatility and potency, allowing them to adapt quickly in battle. Whether channeling destructive forces or weaving illusions, their magic is a reflection of their inner essence.</p>

      <li>Two daggers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Font of Magic<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You begin to draw from an internal wellspring of magic represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>

    <p><strong>Sorcery Points.</strong> You start with 2 sorcery points at 1st level, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Progression table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown in the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <p><strong>Flexible Casting.</strong> You can sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points or use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p>

    <p><strong>Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.</strong> As a bonus action, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell slot's tier.</p>

    <p><strong>Creating Spell Slots.</strong> You can spend sorcery points to gain one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots list shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given tier. You can create spell slots no higher than 5th tier with this feature, and the spell slots you create vanish when you finish a long rest.</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>1st tier = 2 sorcery points</li>
      <li>2nd tier = 3 sorcery points</li>
      <li>3rd tier = 5 sorcery points</li>
      <li>4th tier = 6 sorcery points</li>
      <li>5th tier = 7 sorcery points</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spellcasting<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>As a conduit for arcane power, you can cast Arcane spells.</p>
    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer Progression table.</p>
    <p><strong>Casting Spells.</strong> You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell's tier or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Sorcerer Progression table shows how many spells you know and how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
    <p><strong>Spells Known.</strong> At 1st level, choose two 1st-tier spells from the Arcane spell list to learn. The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer Progression table shows when you learn additional Arcane spells. Each spell you learn must be from a tier for which you have Arcane spell slots. When you gain a level of sorcerer, you can choose one Arcane spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Arcane spell list.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>Spell save DC = 8 + PB + CHA</li>
      <li>Spell attack modifier = PB + CHA</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Metamagic<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 2, 6, 13, and 18)</span></h4>
    <p>You gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs in the moment. You start with two of the following Metamagic feature options of your choice. You gain another option at 6th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
    <p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. To alter a spell with metamagic, a spell must count as an Arcane spell for you.</p>
    <p>When your sorcerer gains a level, you can replace one Metamagic option you know with a different Metamagic option from this list.</p>

    <h5>Careful Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that forces creatures to make a save, you can spend 1 sorcery point to exclude some of them from the effect. When you do, choose a number of those creatures up to your PB. A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its save and takes no damage from the spell.</p>
    <p>You can use the Careful Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>

    <h5>Distant Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase its range by 100 feet. Spells with a range of touch instead have their range increased to 30 feet.</p>

    <h5>Empowered Spell</h5>
    <p>When you roll damage or healing for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of dice up to your CHA modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new roll results.</p>
    <p>You can use the Empowered Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>

    <h5>Enlarged Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell with a range of self that affects an area (not a specific target), you can spend 3 sorcery points to increase the size of the spell's area of effect in one of the following ways (depending on the shape of the spell effect):</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><em>Circle, Cylinder, or Sphere.</em> The radius of circle, sphere, or circular base of the cylinder increases by 5 feet. For example, the darkness spell could be altered to affect a 20-foot-radius sphere (instead of a 15-foot-radius sphere).</li>
      <li><em>Cone.</em> The cone's size increases by 15 feet. For example, the burning hands spell could be altered to affect a 30-foot cone (instead of a 15-foot cone).</li>
      <li><em>Cube.</em> The length of each cube face increases by 5 feet. For example, the thunderwave spell could be altered to affect a 20-foot cube (instead of a 15-foot cube).</li>
      <li><em>Line.</em> The length of the line increases by 15 feet. For example, the lightning bolt spell could be altered to affect a 115-foot line (instead of a 100-foot line).</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Extended Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase its duration to 10 minutes. Spells with a duration of 10 minutes or longer instead have their duration doubled, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p>

    <h5>Flexible Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change the spell's damage type to any other damage type, except psychic. Spells that naturally deal psychic damage can't benefit from the Flexible Spell option.</p>

    <h5>Heightened Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that forces a target to make a save to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first save made against the spell.</p>

    <h5>Hunting Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that requires a target to make a save or take damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cause the spell to deal half damage even if a target succeeds on its save. This damage still affects targets who could normally avoid taking all damage on a successful save (via Evasion or similar features).</p>

    <h5>Lucky Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that requires an attack roll and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to add the total number of Luck that you currently have to the attack roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. Luck isn't expended by this Metamagic option and can subsequently be spent on the attack roll normally.</p>

    <h5>Quickened Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. You can't use this feature to cast two 1st-tier or higher spells on the same turn.</p>

    <h5>Retain Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can spend 2 sorcery point to have advantage on any concentration checks made to maintain the spell for its duration. Your concentration isn't automatically broken for that spell if you become incapacitated, meaning that you can still attempt concentration checks as you normally would.</p>
    <p>You can use the Retain Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>

    <h5>Shielding Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 3 × the spell's tier. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.</p>

    <h5>Subtle Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p>

    <h5>Twinned Spell</h5>
    <p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to 1 + the spell's tier to target a second creature in range with the same spell. (Cantrips cost only 1 sorcery point.)</p>
    <p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current tier. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible but acid arrow and ray of enfeeblement are.</p>

    <h4>Sorcerer Subclass<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 3, 7, 11, and 15)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a subclass that reflects the origins of your magical power. Your choice grants you features as you gain levels.</p>

    <h5>Origin Spells</h5>
    <p>Each sorcerer subclass has a list of origin spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that tier (as shown in the Sorcerer Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells and doesn't count against the number of spells you know. However, casting an origin spell still expends an Arcane spell slot as normal.</p>
    <p>If one of these spells isn't on the Arcane spell list, it still counts as an Arcane spell for you. You can't replace origin spells when you gain a level of sorcerer.</p>

    <h4>Talented<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a talent from the Magic Talents list or increase one ability modifier by +1.</p>

    <h4>Sorcerous Renewal<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 5, 9, 13, and 17)</span></h4>
    <p>When you finish a short rest, roll 1d4 + 1 and regain that many sorcery points.</p>
    <p>At higher levels, your Sorcerous Renewal feature improves: you roll 2d4 + 1 at 9th level, 3d4 + 1 at 13th, and 4d4 + 1 at 17th.</p>

    <h4>Heroic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 10)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the sorcerer's path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Arcane Instruction.</strong> You find new ways to tap into internal magical resources. When you fail an ability check, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add your CHA modifier to the result, potentially turning a failure into a success.</li>
      <li><strong>Innate Spell.</strong> You learn one spell of 1st or 2nd tier from the Arcane, Primordial, or Wyrd spell list. You can cast that spell at its lowest tier by expending a number of sorcery points equal to that spell's tier instead of using a spell slot. When you gain a level in sorcerer, you can replace your innate spell with another spell of 1st or 2nd tier from the available lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Devour Spell<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 14)</span></h4>
    <p>When a creature you can see targets you with a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to immediately draw the spell's power into yourself. Make a CHA check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's tier. On a success, you and every other target of the spell have advantage on saves against it and take only half as much damage from it. You also gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's tier.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can target a magical effect within 30 feet of you that was created by a spell, such as fog cloud or wall of fire. On a successful CHA check, the spell ends.</p>
    <p>Once you successfully devour a spell, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to do so.</p>

    <h4>Epic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 20)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the sorcerer's path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Arcane Conjunction.</strong> When a spell or magical effect affects you, you can use your reaction to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. That creature is affected as though it were also the target. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 10 sorcery points to do so.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Chaos Burst<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>Once per turn when you expend a spell slot, a burst of abyssal energy threatens to unleash chaos. Roll a d20 chaos check to determine whether you unleash a chaos burst. Stronger spells are more likely to trigger the effect. Roll a d20 to determine the chaos burst effect.</p>
  <p><strong>Chaos Check DC = 20 - Spell's Tier</strong></p>

  <h5>Chaos Burst Effects (d20)</h5>
  <ol class="indent">
    <li>You trigger a 3rd tier Fireball centered on yourself.</li>
    <li>A hostile demon tears through a rift from the abyssal plane, appearing in an unoccupied space nearest your target. The GM chooses which type of demon.</li>
    <li>A swarm of flying creatures fills a 20 foot sphere centered on yourself. Everyone in the area has disadvantage on ability, attack, and concentration checks. The swarm remains for 1 minute or until reduced by 50 HP.</li>
    <li>You trigger a 1st tier Thunderwave in a 15 ft radius sphere centered on yourself.</li>
    <li>You cast the Silence spell on yourself. Make a DC 15 CON save at the end of each turn to end the effect.</li>
    <li>You lose all memory of events since your last long rest.</li>
    <li>Your speech is incomprehensible until you finish a long rest. You can still cast spells.</li>
    <li>Your skin changes to an extremely bright color and glows in the dark.</li>
    <li>A Quasit appears and heckles you for one hour.</li>
    <li>You float 20 feet into the air and remain there until the start of your next turn when you glide gently back down.</li>
    <li>Your hands ignite in harmless flames. Until you finish a long rest, your hands radiate torch light. The effects spreads to everything you touch.</li>
    <li>You become incapacitated for 1 minute or until someone uses their action to shake you out of it. Your mind lashes out at hostile creatures within 20 feet of you, or who come within 20 feet for the first time. They take 2d6 psychic damage.</li>
    <li>The target of your spell makes a WIS save or is stunned until the end of their next turn.</li>
    <li>For the next minute, the target of your spell becomes one size larger and its STR increases by 2.</li>
    <li>The target of your spell teleports to an unoccupied space nearest you.</li>
    <li>A non-magical duplicate of yourself appears in the nearest unoccupied space. It has 20 HP, can't cast spells, and has your ability stats. For the next minute before disappearing, it acts on your turn and follows your commands.</li>
    <li>You sprout wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 50 feet for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>You and creatures within 10 feet of you regain 4d8 HP.</li>
    <li>For the next hour, you return to 1 HP if you die.</li>
    <li>You gain resistance to all damage for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4>Channel Chaos<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>When a creature you see casts a spell, you can use your reaction to spend 2 sorcery points to tap into their magical energy, using it to trigger a chaos burst with the spell caster as its target.</p>

  <h4>Distort Fortunes<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>You can use your action once per day to activate a lucky or unlucky aura for 1 minute within a 20 foot radius. You choose if the aura blesses your allies with a +1d4 bonus to attacks saves, or if it curses your enemies with a -1d4 penalty. You can use your bonus action to change the type of aura. This aura does not require concentration. You can spend 4 sorcery points to regain the use of this feature.</p>

  <h4>Erratic Damage<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>When you roll spell attack damage, each time you roll the maximum value on a die, you can add another die to the roll (rolling an 8 on a 1d8 damage roll allows you to roll a second d8).</p>
  <p>When your spell damage knocks someone unconscious, any excess damage can be directed at another creature within 5 feet of the original target.</p>

  <h4>Blessed<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>When you or an ally within 30 ft are attacked or forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to extend divine protective power to the target, granting a one-time +1d4 bonus to their AC or save. You can use this ability PB times per day.</p>

  <h4>Halo<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>Once per day, you can use an action to tap into the divine power within you, causing a halo to appear over your head for 10 minutes. You can dismiss the halo at any time. It disappears if you are incapacitated. The halo sheds bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You gain the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>You add 1d6 radiant damage to spells you cast.</li>
    <li>You gain resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.</li>
    <li>Melee attacks against you do 1d6 radiant damage to the attacker.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Angelic Flight<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>You can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of angelic wings which grant you a flying speed of 30 feet. You can dismiss the wings at any time. They disappear if you are incapacitated.</p>

  <h4>Radiant Presence<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on the radiance of your angelic ancestors and exude a 60ft aura of awe or fear (your choice). For 10 minutes or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a WIS save or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p>

  <h3>Draconic Sorcerer</h3>
  <p>Through lineage, bargain, or unrequited gift, the origins of your magic lie in the preternatural power of dragons. These beings, monumental in their age, power, and size, possess unshakeable bearing, unstoppable might, and mastery over the elements of the natural world.</p>

  <h4>Dragon Ancestor<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You begin to manifest traits of the type of dragon that instilled you with power. Choose that dragon's type now. This choice also dictates some of your spells gained with your Draconic Origin Spells feature, and the damage type associated with each dragon is used by additional features you gain later.</p>
  <p>You can now speak, read, and write Draconic. In addition, when you make an ability check when interacting with or recalling information about dragons, treat any d20 roll less than your sorcerer level as if you rolled a number equal to your sorcerer level.</p>

  <h4>Draconic Origin Spells<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain origin spells at the sorcerer levels listed in the Dragon Ancestor trait. See the Sorcerer Subclass class feature for how these spells work. Note that one of the spells you gain at each listed sorcerer level is determined by the type of dragon you select as your ancestor (see Dragon Ancestor).</p>

  <h4>Draconic Resilience<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Your hit point maximum increases immediately by 1 and by an additional 1 when you gain a level of sorcerer. In addition, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + DEX.</p>

  <h4>Elemental Affinity<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>When you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry (including spells with a damage type modified by features such as your Flexible Spell metamagic option), you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain one of the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Each target takes additional damage equal to your PB.</li>
    <li>You gain resistance to that damage type for 1 minute.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Imperious Wings<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a fly speed equal to your walking speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn, and they last until you dismiss them (also as a bonus action on your turn). While the wings are manifested, creatures that can see you have disadvantage on checks and saves to avoid being frightened or intimidated by you. You can't manifest your wings while wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>

  <h4>Draconian Vengeance<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>As an action, you can target one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to brand it with your draconic element. The target must succeed on a CHA save against your spell save DC or become vulnerable to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry until the end of your next turn. A target resistant to that damage type loses that resistance for the duration, but a target immune to the damage type is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save.</p>
  <p>Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to do so.</p>

  <h3>Infernal Sorcerer</h3>
  <p>Brimming with hellish power, Infernal Sorcerers wield fiery magic and devilish charm. Their powers allow them to manipulate fire with unparalleled skill, deceive with ease, and summon fiendish allies.</p>

  <h4>Infernal Origin Spells<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>When you learn a new spell, you may choose the spell from any spell list as long as that spell deals fire damage. When you cast a fire spell, you can reroll any 1 on the damage dice and use the new value. You learn the Find Familiar ritual. The fiendish spirit you summon can take the form of an imp. You learn the following infernal origin spells as you gain Sorcerer levels.</p>

  <h4>Duplicitous<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain expertise in Persuasion and Deception, doubling your PB for these skills.</p>

  <h4>Devilish Aspect<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>Once per day, you can use an action to tap into the infernal energy within you, causing your eyes to glow like hot coals and magical flames to swirl around you. You shed bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You gain the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Fire spells you cast ignore resistance to fire damage and do +1d6 damage.</li>
    <li>You gain resistance to fire and necrotic damage.</li>
    <li>Melee attacks against you do 1d6 fire damage to the attacker.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infernal Flight<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>You can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of batlike devilish wings which grant you a flying speed of 30 feet. You can dismiss the wings at any time. They disappear if you are incapacitated.</p>

  <h4>Inferno<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to take the form of a blazing humanoid inferno for 10 minutes or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell). All hostile creatures within a 10 ft radius must make a DEX save or take 4d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful save. They must repeat the save any time they end their turn within the radius. You can still cast spells while in your inferno form and you are immune to fire damage.</p>
