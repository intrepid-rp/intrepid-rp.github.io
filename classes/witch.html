    <img src="/assets/images/classes/witch.jpg" />
    <p>A witch is a master of wyrd magic, deeply connected to the spiritual world, with the unique ability to craft enchanted objects and jinx their enemies. They can specialize in a wide array of witchcraft, from brewing powerful potions to creating charms, dreamcatchers, or masks. Witches are often members of secretive covens which help pass down knowledge and provide mutual protection. Their association with the mystical world allows them to commune with infernal, demonic, celestial, or fey spirits. With the ability to harm, heal, deceive, and frighten, witches are versatile adventurers.</p>

  <h2>Witch Subclasses</h2>
  <hr/>
  
  <h3>Coven of the Dreamwalkers</h3>
  <p>Dreamwalker witches draw power from the subconscious. They have learned to quiet the noise of their senses and to trust their intuition to perceive the truths that lie beneath the surface. They embrace the bizarre and beautiful ways of the mind and the collective unconscious that links all beings. These witches rarely meet each other physically, meeting instead in a dream realm they call The Reverie. Each coven member's personal dreamscape within The Reverie is linked to their coven. For example, a door within one witch's castle dreamscape may open onto another witch's walled garden.</p>

  <h4>Coven Spells<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You gain coven spells at the witch levels listed. These spells do not count against the number of witch spells you know.</p>
  <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Witch Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>3</td><td><a href="/spells/?id=detect_thoughts">Detect Thoughts</a>, <a href="/spells/?id=hallucination">Hallucination</a></td></tr>

      </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>Sleep Mastery<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You know the Sleep spell. When you use an action to cast it, you call forth spirits of the dream realm to heighten the spell's effect. You roll an additional 2d8 to determine how much HP the spell can affect.</p>
  <p>You cannot be unwillingly subjected to spells or powers that affect your sleep or dreams such as the Sleep or Dream spells, the sleep effects of the Eyebite or Symbol spells, or the Nightmare Haunting power of a Night Hag.</p>

  <h4>Dreamwalker<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>You teleport into a space adjacent to a creature within 120 feet with an intelligence score of 6 or higher, led to their thoughts through the dream realm. An unwilling target whose thoughts you have not already detected (through the Detect Thoughts or Detect Good or Evil spells, for example) can make a WIS saving throw to resist the effect. On a successful save, you travel only half the distance to the target. You can do this a number of times up to your PB per long rest.</p>

  <h4>Dreamweaver<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>When you use the Dream spell to shape a creature's dreams, you gain the following benefits when pulling the target into your personal dreamscape:
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>For each spell tier above 5th, you can target one additional creature and your monstrous messenger deals +1d6 psychic damage.</li>
      <li>The target of your spell has disadvantage on the WIS save.</li>
      <li>You can target creatures who don't sleep as long as they are in a trance state, however they do not suffer disadvantage on the WIS save.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>Surreal Aura<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>Once per day, you can channel a dreamlike aura, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can exude a dreamlike or nightmare aura (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a WIS saving throw or become charmed or frightened until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3>Coven of the Familiar Masters</h3>
  <p>Some witches focus on the ancient mystic art of forming unique, unbreakable bonds with powerful spirits summoned into animal form. Unlike common familiars, these summoned companions are more than mere servants. They are an extension of a witch's power and will, growing in strength and intelligence alongside their master, becoming formidable allies in battle and wise advisors in times of need.</p>

  <h4>Familiar Master<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>You know the Find Familiar ritual and can cast it using an action to cast it as a spell rather than performing the ritual. This does not require a spell slot and doesn't count against your number of known spells. The spirit you summon is more powerful than a typical familiar and gains the following benefits:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li>Its size is Tiny or Small and takes the form of a Beast or Plant up to CR 1; or an Imp, Quasit, or Pseudodragon.</li>
    <li>It uses your PB for saves and ability checks.</li>
    <li>It adds your PB to its usual armor class.</li>
    <li>Its HP is equal to your CHA modifier + three times your witch level. For example, a second level witch with +3 CHA would summon a familiar with 9 HP (3+(3*2)).</li>
    <li>Its attacks are enhanced by your bond. It uses your spell attack bonus or its normal attack bonus, whichever is higher.</li>
    <li>Its attacks deal force damage equal to 1d4 + its STR or DEX + your PB. Additional damage or effects from its attacks still apply (extra poison damage, grappling, etc).</li>
    <li>Its INT modifier is 8 unless it's already higher.</li>
    <li>It can understand and speak Common and either Celestial, Sylvan, Abyssal, or Infernal depending on its origins.</li>
    <li>You can access your familiar's senses as a bonus action.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Teleportation Bond<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>You can teleport your familiar to your side as a bonus action. You can use your action to disappear in a puff of smoke and teleport to your familiar as long as it is within 60 feet of you. You can do this PB times per day.</p>

  <h4>Cooperative Spellcasting<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>You can cast ranged spells through your familiar as long as it is within 60 feet of you. The spell originates from your familiar's position and the spell range is limited to 30 feet.</p>

  <h4>Familiar Aura<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>As an action on your turn, you can have your familiar emit one of two auras for 1 minute. You can take this action PB times per day.</p>
  <ul class="indent">
    <li><em>Bless.</em> Your familiar emits aura of daylight in a 20-foot radius. Allies within the aura gain a 1d4 bonus to attacks, saves, and ability checks.</li>
    <li><em>Bane.</em> Your familiar emits an aura of chaotic energy in a 20-foot radius. Enemies who enter the aura for the first time must succeed on a WIS save based on your spell save DC. If they fail the save, they subtract 1d4 from their attacks, saves, and ability checks a long as they are within the aura.</li>
  </ul>
