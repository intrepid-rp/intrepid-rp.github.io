      <li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
      <li>(a) 10 darts or (b) 2 daggers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Unarmored Defense<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + DEX + WIS.</p>

    <h4>Martial Arts<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You have mastered combat styles that use unarmed strikes and <strong>monk weapons</strong>, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons. When you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons, and you aren't using heavy armor or shields:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>You can replace the normal damage from you unarmed strikes or weapon attacks with your martials arts die, which changes as you gain monk levels.</li>
      <li>You can use DEX instead of STR for attack and damage rolls of you unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
      <li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li>
      <li>When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile. The damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + DEX + monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you catch the missile (if it's small enough to hold in a free hand) and can then make a ranged attack with it as part of the same reaction. You are proficient with this attack which uses your martial arts die for damage and has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ki Mastery<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 2)</span></h4>
    <p>Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of your life force. Characters may refer to this energy by different names (Ki, Prana, Pneuma, Mana, etc) or they may access this power intuitively without having a word for it. The game mechanics will refer to "Ki" but your character will call it what they want. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points.</p>
    <p class="indent"><strong>Ki Point Total</strong> = Your monk level + WIS</p>
    <p>You can spend these points to fuel various ki techniques which you learn as you gain monk levels. You recover expended ki points by meditating for 30 minutes as part of a short or long rest.</p>
    <p>If a ki feature requires your target to make a saving throw, the save DC is calculated as follows:</p>
    <p class="indent"><strong>Ki Save DC</strong> = 8 + PB + WIS</p>
    <p>You know three of the following <strong>Ki Techniques</strong>:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><strong>Flurry of Blows.</strong> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</li>
      <li><strong>Flurry of Throws.</strong> Immediately after making a thrown weapon attack on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two thrown weapon attacks as a bonus action.</li>
      <li><strong>Patient Defense.</strong> When you are targeted by an attack you can see, you may spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action using a reaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Step of the Wind.</strong> You can spend 1 ki point to both Disengage and Dash as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled.</li>
      <li><strong>Whirling Defense.</strong> When you take the Dodge action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point and deploy a dynamic defense through continuous weapon movement, gaining a +2 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.</li>
      <li><strong>Springing Strike.</strong> You can spend 1 ki point to increase the reach of your melee attacks by 5 feet until the start of your next turn.</li>
      <li><strong>Parry.</strong> When you are hit with a melee attack, you can spend 1 ki point to use your reaction and reduce the damage by an amount equal to your DEX + martial arts die.</li>
      <li><strong>Riposte.</strong> When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can spend 1 ki point to use your reaction and make a melee weapon attack against the creature. Add one extra Martial Arts die to the damage roll.</li>
      <li><strong>Crushing Blow.</strong> Once per turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause extra damage equal to your Martial Arts die.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Unarmored Movement<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 2)</span></h4>

    <p>You commit yourself to a distinct type of monk training, or subclass, offering distinct abilities and powers reflective of your character's unique training or traditions. Whether honed in the solitude of remote monasteries or under the guidance of a revered master, each subclass embodies a particular philosophy or approach to martial arts and mysticism. These subclasses grant practitioners a focused array of abilities, ranging from combat techniques or stealth, to mystical powers that align with their chosen path.</p>

The amount of ki required increases by 1 for each creature size above Medium.</p>

    <h4>Ki-Empowered Strikes<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 6)</span></h4>
    <p>Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>

    <h4>Evasion<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 6)</span></h4>
    <p>When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a DEX saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed, and only half damage if you fail.</p>

    <h4>Transcendent Movement<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 9)</span></h4>

    <p>Your spirit sustains you, body and mind. You gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>You can't be magically aged and suffer none of the frailty of old age. You can still die of old age, however.</li>
      <li>You no longer need food or water.</li>
      <li>Your ability scores and hit point maximum can't be lowered or reduced by any means short of a wish spell.</li>
