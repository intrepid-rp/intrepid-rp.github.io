    </ul>

    <h4>Last Stand<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>When you take damage that would reduce your HP to less than half your HP maximum (rounded down), you can use your reaction to spend hit dice, up to a number equal to your PB. Immediately roll those hit dice. You regain HP equal to the sum of all dice rolled + your CON modifier.</p>

    <h4>Martial Action<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 1)</span></h4>
    <p>You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to perform a weapon option or one of the martial actions granted by this feature. Choose one of the following martial actions that you know.</p>
    <h5>Aim</h5>
    <p><em>Requires Wielding a Ranged or Thrown Weapon</em><br>
      As a bonus action, you take the time to increase the effectiveness of your next ranged weapon attack. Select one target you can see. If you make a ranged weapon attack against that target before the end of your turn, double your PB for the first attack roll.</p>
    <h5>Guard</h5>
    <p><em>Requires Wielding a Shield</em><br>
      As a bonus action, you raise your shield to intercept incoming attacks. Select one enemy creature within 5 feet of you. That creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or an ally within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn.</p>
    <h5>Quick Strike</h5>
    <p><em>Requires Wielding Two Light Weapons</em><br>
      After you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a different Light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand—instead of the one attack typically granted by two-weapon fighting. Don't add your ability modifier to the damage of these additional attacks unless the modifier is negative.</p>
    <h5>Wind Up</h5>
    <p><em>Requires Wielding a Heavy or a Versatile Melee Weapon with Both Hands</em><br>
      As a bonus action, you ready a powerful attack against a nearby target. Select one target you can see within 10 feet of you. If you hit that target with a melee weapon attack before the end of your turn, the first such attack deals extra damage equal to your PB (of the same damage type as the weapon).</p>

    <h4>Action Surge<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 2, 13, and 18)</span></h4>
    <p>When the need is great, you push your body to its absolute limit. On your turn, you can activate this feature to gain another action—in addition to the action and possible bonus action you regularly get on your turn.</p>
    <p>You must complete a short or long rest before using this feature again. Starting at 13th level, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on the same turn. At 18th level, you can use it three times.</p>

    <h4>Fighter Subclass<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 3, 7, 11, and 15)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a subclass that reflects your role in battle. Your choice grants you features as you progress.</p>

    <h4>Talented<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 19)</span></h4>
    <p>Choose a talent from the Martial Talents list or increase one ability modifier by +1.</p>

    <h4>Multiattack<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Levels 5, 9, and 17)</span></h4>
    <p>Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. Starting at 9th level, you can make three attacks when you take the Attack action. At 17th level, you can make four.</p>

    <h4>Heroic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 10)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the fighter's path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defiant.</strong> When you fail a save, you can instead choose to succeed on the save. You can use this feature once per long rest. You can use it twice before a long rest at 13th level, and three times at 17th.</li>
      <li><strong>Unstoppable.</strong> When you start your turn, you can choose to end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, charmed, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, or stunned. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB per long rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Epic Boon<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 20)</span></h4>
    <p>Your commitment to the fighter's path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Turn the Tide.</strong> Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature or object with a weapon attack on your turn, you can cause the attack to deal additional damage (of the same damage type as the weapon) equal to 10 + your STR or DEX modifier (your choice). The attack's damage ignores resistance and immunity, and it can't be reduced or avoided by any means.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Fighter Subclasses</h2>
  <hr/>

  <h3>Weapon Master</h3>
  <p>Most fighters feel a deep connection to their weapons, but none more so than the Weapon Master. For them, a favored bow or blade is a natural extension of their body and a trusted ally. Fighters who pursue this subclass learn to use their chosen arms with efficiency and artistry.</p>

  <h4>Mastery<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>Choose three types of simple or martial weapons with which you have proficiency. You have mastered the use of those three weapons.</p>
  <p>Once per turn, when you roll damage for an attack with a weapon you have mastered, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either result.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, once per turn, when you use a weapon option for a weapon that you have mastered, you can roll the attack's damage even if the weapon option doesn't normally allow it.</p>

  <h4>Stunts<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 3)</span></h4>
  <p>As part of your training, you've learned to use unique tactics with certain weapons. You gain access to special maneuvers called stunts.</p>
  <p>To use a stunt, you must wield a weapon that matches the weapon type listed in the stunt description (if one is listed). You can only use one stunt per turn. You gain access to advanced stunts at higher levels.</p>
  <p>Some stunts require your target to make a save to resist its effects. The save DC for these stunts is calculated as follows:</p>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Stunt save DC</strong> = 8 + PB + your STR or DEX modifier (your choice)</p>
  <p>All stunts listed are available to you at 3rd level. You can perform stunts a number of times equal to your PB + 1. After that, you must finish a short or long rest to regain expended uses.</p>

  <h5>Arcing Strike</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Heavy Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When you deal damage with a heavy weapon wielded in both hands, you can also deal half the damage you dealt to a different target within reach that you can see. If the second target is an object, it takes the full damage instead. You can decide to use this after you know your damage roll.
  
  <h5>Cheap Shot</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When you successfully hit a target with a melee weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately make an unarmed strike against that target as part of the same Attack action.</p>
  
  <h5>Make It Count</h5>
  <p>When you take the Attack action, you can make a single weapon attack with a +10 to the attack roll. On a hit, the attack deals additional damage equal to your fighter level. You can't make additional attacks as part of that Attack action, even if a feature like Multiattack would normally allow you to do so.</p>

  <h5>Parry</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When a creature you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d10 + your PB (to a minimum of 0 damage).</p>

  <h5>Redirect</h5>
  <p>When you miss a target with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to immediately reroll the attack, but you must select a different target you can see within 5 feet of the original target.</p>

  <h5>Riposte</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When a creature you can see within range misses you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>

  <h5>Straight Through</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Ranged Weapon</em><br>
  When you deal damage with a ranged weapon attack, you can also deal half the damage you dealt to a different target you can see within 5 feet of the original target. You can decide to use this after you know your damage roll.</p>

  <h5>Tactical Retreat</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When you hit a creature with a weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately move up to half your speed as part of the same action without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

  <h4>Deadly Flourish<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 7)</span></h4>
  <p>Attacks made with weapons you have mastered through your Mastery feature score critical hits on rolls of 19 or 20. When you score a critical hit, you can use your reaction to do one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a ranged weapon attack against a number of creatures equal to your PB within 15 feet of the target hit by your critical hit.</li>
    <li>Make a separate melee attack against each creature within 5 feet of you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Advanced Stunts<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 11)</span></h4>
  <p>The following powerful stunts are available to you whenever you could use a stunt.</p>

  <h5>Assassin's Ambush</h5>
  <p>When you hit a creature, from which you are hidden, with a weapon attack, roll your weapon damage dice twice instead of once. On a critical hit, roll the weapon's damage dice three times instead of twice.</p>

  <h5>Bulwark</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Shield</em><br>
  When you take damage from a spell or ability that requires a save, such as the fireball spell, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage dealt to you by an amount equal to your AC. Psychic damage can't be reduced by this stunt.</p>

  <h5>Felling Sweep</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Heavy Melee Weapon</em><br>
  As an action, you can make a single melee attack that targets each creature within reach, using a single attack and damage roll.</p>

  <h5>Preemptive Strike</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When a creature comes within reach of your weapon, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against it. On a hit, the target's speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>

  <h5>Rapid Release</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Ranged or Thrown Weapon</em><br>
  After you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with a ranged or thrown weapon. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of the attack.</p>

  <h5>Wrestler's Clutch</h5>
  <p><em>Requires a Melee Weapon</em><br>
  When you hit a creature with a melee attack, the creature must succeed on a STR save or become grappled by you. While this grapple persists, stunts you use against the grappled creature don't expend uses of your Stunts feature. This grapple ends if you attack another creature, the target escapes, or you end it (no action required).</p>

  <h4>Grand Finale<span class="lvl">&nbsp;(Level 15)</span></h4>
  <p>When you roll initiative and have no uses of your Stunts feature remaining, you can regain 3 uses. You must complete a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
