  <p><strong>Age.</strong> Although elves reach physical maturity around age 20, mental and emotional faculties reach full maturity around the age of 100. Elves can live to be 750 years old.</p>
  <p><strong>Size.</strong> Elves range from under 5 feet to over 6 feet tall and tend toward slender builds, averaging around 110 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
  <p><strong>Heightened Senses.</strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill. You can see through lightly obscured areas normally and areas of dim light as if it were bright light.</p>
  <p><strong>Magic Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saves against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.</p>
  <p><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they enter a meditative trance state, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day. You choose whether or not you can dream while meditating. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that other creatures do from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
