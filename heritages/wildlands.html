  <p>Wildlands heritage characters grow up in wild areas filled with powerful natural magic, possibly from a connection to the fey realms or ancient spells. This magic changes the animals, making them wise and able to speak. They form nature-based societies different from humanoid ones, where beastkin and humanoids live alongside one another in harmony. Members of these communities protect their way of life. When encroaching civilization threatens, they send out their more humanoid members to gather information or negotiate.</p>
  <p><strong>Beast Affinity.</strong> Using a combination of both gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with Beasts, and you have advantage on checks made to interact with nonhostile Beasts.</p>
  <p><strong>Shepherdâ€™s Gift.</strong> You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. Any nonmagical Beast whose CR is equal to or less than your PB that targets you with an attack must first make a WIS check contested by your WIS (Animal Handling). If you succeed, the beast must choose a new target or lose the attack. If you fail, it attacks normally. If you attack or deal damage to a creature, or cast a spell that affects a hostile creature, this effect ends for all Beasts that can see or hear you.</p>
  <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You know Common and one additional language, typically Sylvan.</p>
