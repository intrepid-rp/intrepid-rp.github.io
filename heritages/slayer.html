  <p>Long ago, groups of beastkin lived among fierce animals like tigers, bears, sharks, and scorpions. It's unclear how they survived, but their descendants, called slayers, are skilled hunters, trackers, and gatherers. Slayer communities focus on hunting powerful creatures like dragons or trolls to maintain balance in nature. Sometimes they get paid to kill specific monsters, but mostly they buy what they need using treasures from monster lairs or profits from selling monster parts. Because their lives are risky, slayers value strength and tracking ability. Those who can't hunt anymore because of age, sickness, or injury are respectfully retired and supported by non-slayer relatives. There are also stories of hidden villages where retired slayers live.</p>
  <p><strong>Ferocity.</strong> You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. Any nonmagical Beast whose CR is equal to or less than your PB that targets you with an attack must first make a WIS check contested by your CHA (Intimidation). If you succeed, the beast must choose a new target or lose the attack. If you fail, it attacks normally. If you attack or deal damage to a creature, or cast a spell that affects a hostile creature, this effect ends for all Beasts that can see or hear you.</p>
  <p><strong>Tracker.</strong> When you make a check to locate, spot, or track a creature, you can add your PB to the roll. If you have proficiency in the skill or tool being used, add double your PB.</p>
  <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You know Common and one additional language, with Primordial being common.</p>
