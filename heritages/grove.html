  <p>Grove heritage characters were raised in the values of grove elf communities. When elves first appeared, many settled in lush forests, becoming the first grove elves. They built communities that lived in harmony with nature, not trying to control it. These elves protect their forests, worshiping in sacred groves and defending their land against intruders. As cities expand and natural areas shrink, many creatures now share the grove elves' values. Anyone who respects the wild is welcome to settle among them.</p>
