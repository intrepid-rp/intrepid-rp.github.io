  <p>Fireforge heritage characters were raised in the values and customs of fireforge dwarven clans. Dwarven legends agree that the best metalworking happens in the earth's fiery depths. Long ago, dwarves settled near volcanic areas, turning them into forges. These dwarves founded the fireforge clans. Today, they still work in magma's heat, crafting exceptional weapons, armor, and goods. They trade these for necessities not found in their settlements' harsh environment. Fireforge communities have friendly ties with elemental creatures, aiding each other when necessary. In return, elementals help them against giants, dragons, and other creatures who often compete for territory.</p>
