  <p>Cloud heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of cloud elf communities. Long ago, a group of elves calling themselves mages built towers where they studied the magical forces that flowed through the cosmos. These towers eventually became the hearts of thriving cities. People from all over the world are attracted to these communities to learn magic or be with others who share their passion for it.</p>
