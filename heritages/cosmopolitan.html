  <p>Cosmopolitan characters are citizens of the world whose values, interests, and ideas are influenced by exposure to many different cultures. Creatures of this heritage hail from major cities populated by people from many different parts of the world. Alternatively, it could mean you spent your formative years moving from place to place, immersing yourself in the customs and traditions of each community you lived with.</p>
  <p><strong>Street Smarts.</strong> While in a city or other urban environment, you have advantage on ability checks made to avoid getting lost and checks made to find a particular kind of business or other destination open to the public. Additionally, while you are in such environments, you can’t be surprised unless you are asleep or otherwise incapacitated.</p>
  <p><strong>Worldly Wisdom.</strong> When you make a check related to understanding the purpose or significance of a building, rite, or object from a culture you aren’t familiar with, you can add your PB to the roll. If you have proficiency in a relevant skill or tool, add double your PB to the roll.</p>
  <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You know Common and two additional languages of your choice, with Dwarvish and Elvish being the most common.</p>
