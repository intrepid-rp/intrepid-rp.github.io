  <p>Stone heritage characters are brought up in the traditions and values of the stone dwarf clans, emphasizing tradition and honoring ancestors who ensured their safety underground. From a young age, they are taught skills like smithing, metalworking, and masonry, often dedicating their lives to mining precious metals. However, life in their cities is challenging, as they face constant threats from other underground creatures. Children are trained not only in mining but also in defending their homes against these enemies.</p>
