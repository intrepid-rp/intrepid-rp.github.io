  <p>Farming and herding dominate daily life in your small village, where life ebbs and flows with the steady cadence of the seasons and the harvest. Your community is built on deep family ties, hard work, and mutual support. While village life can seem boring and predictable to some, it can also face occasional outside threats to the usual peace and tranquility. Whatever you reasons for leaving village life behind and embracing adventure, your work ethic and tendency to form deep bonds with your companions serve you well.</p>
  <p><strong>Beast Affinity.</strong> Using a combination of both gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with Beasts, and you have advantage on checks made to interact with nonhostile Beasts.</p>
  <p><strong>Shepherd's Gift.</strong> You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. Any nonmagical Beast whose CR is equal to or less than your PB that targets you with an attack must first make a WIS check contested by your WIS (Animal Handling). If you succeed, the beast must choose a new target or lose the attack. If you fail, it attacks normally. If you attack or deal damage to a creature, or cast a spell that affects a hostile creature, this effect ends for all Beasts that can see or hear you.</p>
  <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You know Common and one additional language, typically Sylvan.</p>
